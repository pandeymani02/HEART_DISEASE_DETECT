# HEART_DISEASE_DETECT
Machine Learning model which uses logistic regression algorithm for analyzing the input and giving the output according to the training set.

Here we have used different algorithms first and analysed their accuracy and the one with the largest accuracy is selected for our main project.
Algorithms analysed are KNN,DECISION TREES, LOGISTIC REGRESSION and SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES.
The best accuracy is obtained using Logistic Regression Model.
